# Synthesizer
A pretty and functional GUI-based synthesizer coded in Java.
This synthesizer can be used to create, edit, and play musical sequences designed through the grid
interface. Tones for each note are electronically generated and can sound concurrently to simulate
chords.

Musical sequences can only be edited when the sheet is paused. Notes are added by clicking on a blank
grid tile. Each note’s accidental and volume can be adjusted by left‐clicking on an existing note or
scrolling the mouse wheel while hovering over an existing note, respectively. Additionally, longer,
sustained notes can be created by shift‐clicking a note which has horizontally adjacent notes of identical
properties.

Single notes and components of sustained notes can be deleted by right‐clicking on the note. Finally,
breaks can be inserted in sustained notes by shift‐right‐clicking part of the sustained note.
The control panel includes Play, Pause, Rewind, Add Page, Save, and Open buttons. These buttons are
used to control playback, save progress, or open an existing project.

The tempo of playback can be adjusted by the orange slider located on the control panel. The smaller
slider underneath the control panel can be used to scroll through the sheets of a project.
